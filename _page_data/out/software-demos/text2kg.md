name: Text2KG
byline: An Automated Text to Knowledge Graph System
description: Text2kg is a system for converting raw text into a knowledge graph via an NLP pipeline. Our system uses a pipeline-based approach to extract a set of triples from a given document. It offers a simple and effective solution to the challenge of knowledge graph construction from domain-specific text. Text2kg was our entry to the ICDM 2019 Knowledge Graph Contest, where we won first prize.
