This enables content producers and communication professionals to react quickly and incorporate the latest trends into their decision-making - by forecasting future topics, for example, visualizing the relevance of these topics for specific products or services, or identifying opinion leaders who might help promote a product or amplify a message.<br/>The talk will present results from ongoing European <a href="https://www.weblyzard.com/research/">research initiatives</a>, including a live demonstration of a visual analytics dashboard with a focus on sustainability and brand communication. It will discuss how Artificial Intelligence and semantic technologies can support the entire digital content value chain, from the data-driven production to the distribution, promotion and analysis of content assets.<br/><b>Short Bio</b><br/>Prof Dr Arno Scharl is the Managing Partner of <a href="https://www.storypact.com/">Storypact</a> and <a href="https://www.weblyzard.com">webLyzard technology</a>, and a Professor of Information Systems at the <a href="https://www.modul.ac.at/about/academic-schools/research-center-of-new-media-technology">New Media Technology</a> Research Center of Modul University Vienna.
