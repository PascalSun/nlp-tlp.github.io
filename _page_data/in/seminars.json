            "article": "<b><a href=\"https://youtu.be/dg9sUjBqfCM\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to watch the recording of the seminar.</a></b><br/><b>Seminar Abstract</b><br/>Opinions about current and future events are reflected in stakeholder Web sites and the public debate across news outlets, participatory platforms, social media, etc. Extracting emerging stories from these channels provides a real-time window into consumer and stakeholder perceptions. This enables content producers and communication professionals to react quickly and incorporate the latest trends into their decision-making - by forecasting future topics, for example, visualizing the relevance of these topics for specific products or services, or identifying opinion leaders who might help promote a product or amplify a message.<br/>The talk will present results from ongoing European <a href=\"https://www.weblyzard.com/research/\">research initiatives</a>, including a live demonstration of a visual analytics dashboard with a focus on sustainability and brand communication. It will discuss how Artificial Intelligence and semantic technologies can support the entire digital content value chain, from the data-driven production to the distribution, promotion and analysis of content assets.<br/><b>Short Bio</b><br/>Prof Dr Arno Scharl is the Managing Partner of <a href=\"https://www.storypact.com/\">Storypact</a> and <a href=\"https://www.weblyzard.com\">webLyzard technology</a>, and a Professor of Information Systems at the <a href=\"https://www.modul.ac.at/about/academic-schools/research-center-of-new-media-technology\">New Media Technology</a> Research Center of Modul University Vienna. Previously, he held professorships at the University of Western Australia and Graz University of Technology, and was a Visiting Fellow at Curtin University and the University of California at Berkeley. After completing his doctoral research and habilitation at the Vienna University of Economics and Business, Prof. Scharl has authored 190 refereed publications and edited two books in Springer\u2018s Advanced Information and Knowledge Processing Series. In various roles including Coordinator, R&D Lead and System Integration Lead, he helped acquire and manage more than 30 European and Austrian research projects. His current research interests focus on Web intelligence and visual analytics, opinion mining, AI-based communication success metrics, information visualization and the integration of semantic and geospatial technology."
