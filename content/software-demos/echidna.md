byline: A Knowledge Graph for Maintenance
description: This tool offers maintainers and reliability engineers a completely novel and powerful way to analyse their work orders. While it is still a work in progress, in its current state it allows users to filter and query work orders by using knowledge captured within both the work order text and the structured fields (e.g. "Date" and "Functional location description").
