name: An Efficient Neural Probabilistic Logical Resolution for Multi-class Multi-label Entity Typing
authors: Ziyu Zhao
description: Integrating the representative ability of deep neural network with probabilistic logical reasoning is still an open and a challenging problem. It brings expensive computation cost due to the exponentially large searching space in knowledge representation and knowledge compilation. Ziyu's research interest is to combine deep learning with logic and probability theory for linguistics computing, taking into account knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning.
