name: Rectifying knowledge graph link prediction using embedding-enhanced ontologies
authors: Tom Smoker
description: Knowledge graph rectification is using domain or high-level understanding to add, remove or alter predicted links in knowledge graphs.  Given the advances of knowledge graph embeddings and their use in link prediction, codified logical understanding at a class level can be used to further improve these links and associated knowledge graphs.
