name: Semi-automated Estimation of Reliability Measures from Maintenance Work Order Records
authors: Tyler Bikaun and Melinda Hodkiewicz
description: Determining mean-time-between-failure (MTBF) estimation for in-service assets is an essential process. We emulate the process of end-of-life event detection using a natural language processing pipeline followed by statistical parameter estimation to produce MTBF values for inservice assets from maintenance work order data. <br/>The source code is <a href="https://code-ittc.csiro.au/tyler.bikaun/mtbf_from_mwo" target="_blank">available online</a>.
