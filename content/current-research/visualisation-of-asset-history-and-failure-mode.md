name: Visualisation of Asset History and Failure Mode Determination
authors: Michael Stewart and Melinda Hodkiewicz

This project aims to construct knowledge graphs from maintenance work orders in order to visualise historic asset data, provide decision support to reliability engineers, and allow for easy identification of failure modes.
